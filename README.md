# Decrypted Lecture Notes

# **CHECK THE `main` BRANCH FOR LATEST CODE**

This branch doesn't have the files supported


For the NITP 2k19-23 batch.

Provides decrypted lecture notes, download and read, no need to always enter password.

> See the `src/pages/index.tsx` file for code, it is the main code for the page you see at https://cs4401.netlify.app

There are in-code comments, for any further issue/\`any\` doubt, raise an issue here or dm.

## Decrypting and Updating data

The site lists all pdf and zip files inside a google cloud storage bucket.
So we need some automation to automatically update the files inside it, with latest files added in the google drive folder.

This command handles it : 

```sh
python3 code.py
```

After this everything is automated, the steps in brief are:

1. Downloading new files from google drive folder
2. Decrypting pdfs
3. Creating zip (of Unit-I, Unit-II, ...)
4. Uploading updated files to google cloud storage
5. Then the website (rest of the code here) automatically displays the new data as available in the cloud storage

> An interesting change can be, modify Step 4 to upload to a google drive folder itself, instead of cloud storage, that way you won't even need this website, though i leave it as is, as for most, this website is much faster

All of this is automated, see the `code.py` file for more details and comments to how it is done :D
